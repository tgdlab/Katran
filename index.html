<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>
At <strong>Katran</strong>, we train and employ women from marginalized communities to up-cycle textile waste into functional accessories and clothing.
We collaborate with NGOs providing basic tailoring skills, and enhance them with upcycling craft to make women market ready.
So far, we’ve trained over 5,000 women and upcycled nearly 10 tons of textile waste.
Today, we have a team of about 100 women connected across communities in India and have successfully upcycled 8 tons of fabric waste in under 4 years.

<h2>About the Founder</h2>
<p>
My staunch belief in frugal design and innovation led me to experiment early on with materials and forms.
After witnessing the wasteful and exploitative nature of the garment industry, I began raising awareness about fast fashion and promoting responsible consumer behavior.
Launched in 2017, Katran is the natural outcome of my passion for sustainable fashion.
I continue to give guest lectures at top-tier fashion institutes and conduct corporate workshops to promote upcycling and recycling.
